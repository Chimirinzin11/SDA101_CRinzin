What i Implemented :
 I implemented a simple student profile layout using HTML and basic inline CSS styling. I added a title, a main heading with customized color, and an image that is centered using CSS styling. I also included a short personal introduction describing my education background and current degree. The page contains a paragraph about software engineering, as well as an ordered list highlighting my hobbies. Additionally, I used basic HTML tags such as headings, paragraphs, lists, bold, italic, mark, and hyperlinks to structure and present the information clearly.



 What I Learned?
 While creating this webpage, I learned how different HTML tags work together to structure content in a meaningful way. I also gained experience using inline CSS to style elements such as background color, text color, and image alignment. Through this activity, I understood the importance of organizing code properly inside the <head> and <body> sections, as well as writing clean and readable HTML. Overall, this task strengthened my understanding of how to build a simple webpage and how CSS can enhance the design and layout.
