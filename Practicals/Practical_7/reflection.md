I implemented a styled button using HTML and Tailwind CSS. I used Tailwind utility classes to add properties such as padding, background color, rounded corners, hover effects, and transitions. This allowed me to create a clean and responsive button without writing any custom CSS. Through this task, I gained skills in using Tailwind utility classes, designing interactive UI elements, and improving the appearance and usability of buttons in web pages.
