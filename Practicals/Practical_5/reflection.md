In this task, I implemented an HTML webpage that displays semester grade details using a well-structured table. I created table rows and headings to organize information such as the module name, assignment title, maximum marks, obtained marks, percentage, and grade. I also applied simple CSS styling—specifically border-collapse—to make the table cleaner and more readable. Through this implementation, I gained skills in creating and formatting HTML tables, using table elements like <tr>, <th>, and <td>, and applying basic CSS styling to improve the appearance of a webpage. Additionally, I strengthened my understanding of how to organize academic data clearly and professionally in a web document.
