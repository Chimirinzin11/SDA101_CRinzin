[what_I_Learned]
I learned to use of Figma's specific tools, including Frames, Shapes, Auto Layout, components, and text/color styles to build layouts efficiently.
Moreover I learned to structure and organize content in a logical way, ensuring a clear information hierarchy and intuitive navigation flow for users.
Wireframing in Figma serves as a foundation for building interactive prototypes, allowing us to simulate user interactions (e.g., clicks, hover effects, transitions) and test the functionality before development begins.

[skills_I_Implemented]
to create wireframes (food ordering ) in Figma, several skills were used:
First I Planned the layout: Organizing the screens and features logically so that users can easily find what they need.
Secondly by Creating visual structure: Using simple shapes (like boxes and lines) and basic text styles to show where things will go, making sure the most important information stands out.
Laastly Using Figma tools: Knowing how to use the basic functions within Figma, such as frames, shapes, and text boxes, to build the skeletal structure of the design.
