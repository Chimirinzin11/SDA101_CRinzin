In this task, I implemented a complete HTML form for submitting hostel room maintenance requests. I structured the page with different sections such as resident details, room information, floor number, and issue type. I used various form elements including text fields, number fields, dropdown menus, email inputs, and validation attributes like required, minlength, maxlength, pattern, and min/max to ensure correct user input. I also organized the form using labels to improve usability and accessibility. Through this implementation, I gained practical skills in building HTML forms, applying form validation, structuring user-input sections clearly, and improving form usability. This helped strengthen my understanding of how to collect and manage user data effectively in a web application
